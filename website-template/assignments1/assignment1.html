<h1>404 Page Not Found</h1>

	<p>Kate Wagner’s essay "404 Page Not Found" critiques the internet's change from a free, amateur space to a corporate, uniform platform. Her idea of "technological cannibalism" where the internet eats its own history while getting rid of it is notable. Wagner says, "The new internet knows this, and it capitalizes on my nostalgia as it eats away at the old internet," underscoring how tech companies profit from the culture they erase.</p>
<p>A strong part of her argument is how platforms like Instagram recycle elements of early internet cultur like low resolution GIFs and glitter text while losing their original meaning. She explains, "These gifs come from Giphy, which has been integrated with Instagram for years. They’re lores, imperfect, and entirely decontextualized." This showcases a wider digital trend where visual aspects remain, but the original spirit of personal expression and creativity is lost. The same platforms that removed Geocities and Myspace now offer sanitized, nostalgia driven fragments of those spaces as fleeting content.</p>
<p>Wagner’s points about the decline of Web 1.0 aesthetics further strengthen her argument. She mentions internet historian Olia Lialina, who noted that early personal web pages were "full of hope for a faster connection and a more powerful computer." These amateur sites, known for their messy but unique designs, starkly contrast with today’s smooth, standardized interfaces. "Users must now operate within the hell of beautiful interfaces designed by experts," Wagner laments. This shift represents not just a loss of design variety but a major change in how users interact once active creators, users are now passive consumers. The growing corporate nature of the web has minimized its creative possibilities, turning it into a space where user engagement follows algorithms and profit rather than personal expression.</p>
<p>Wagner also considers the larger consequences of this change regarding digital history and memory. The fast loss of old websites and digital communities means that important parts of internet culture are disappearing. Unlike traditional history, much of the early internet wasn’t properly saved, and as platforms like Myspace and Tumblr delete content or close down, large amounts of user generated history are lost. The same corporations that encourage user engagement today do little to keep the past intact, effectively wiping out vital parts of digital history. Wagner states that this trend highlights the internet's fragile relationship with being temporary: "The artifacts of internet life are personal that is, not professionally or historically notable and therefore worthless." This question raises important issues about who gets to determine what is kept and what is forgotten in the digital era. </p>
<p>Although Wagner’s sense of loss for the old internet is clear, her essay is more than just a lament it serves as a warning. The internet, once a space for exploration and self expression, has turned into a heavily controlled, profit focused area. Yet, as she notes, there is still resistance. Movements like vaporwave creatively reinterpret digital aesthetics with irony, and "Weird Facebook" groups intentionally disrupt the polished experience of social media. These subcultures push back against the corporate web’s sameness and suggest a chance to regain some of what has been lost. Furthermore, projects like Neocities and the IndieWeb movement show that there is ongoing interest in a more open and user controlled digital world.</p>
<p>In response to Wagner’s essay, we should consider: Can we create an internet that values creativity and individual expression over profit and control? As She suggests that while the old internet might be gone, its remnants still exist. The task is to make sure these remnants do not just remind us of the past but help us move toward a more open and creative online future. By backing alternative platforms, open source initiatives, and efforts to preserve digital content, we can fight against the uniformity of the internet and regain some of the imaginative freedom that used to characterize the online world.</p>
